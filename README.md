The term "phreaking" comes from the idea that this is meant to be used with telephony.
GraveStone allows you to easily perform hardware encryption on any cell phone for protecting conversations.

This, in effect, hides your conversations from surveillance, and possible wiretapping.

The idea is to allow you to make encrypted phone calls without revealing that you're using encryption.
